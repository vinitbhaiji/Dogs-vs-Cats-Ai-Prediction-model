# Dogs-vs-Cats-Ai-Prediction-model

It is a basic ML model used to describe whether the given image is of a cat or a dog. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to predict the image using the Image Data Generator module from the Keras library.

I have used the dataset obtained from Kaggel: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirensk/cats-vs-dogs-training8000test2000> with over 4000 images of cats and dogs each and used only 200 images to train the model in order to avoid the problem of overfitting. 
The accuracy I have obtained is around 70 percent.

The out I have returned is a simple print statement here, as 'Dog' or 'Cat'
